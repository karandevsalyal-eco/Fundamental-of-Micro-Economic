# 📘 What is Economics? — Scarcity & Choice

---

## 1️⃣ What is Economics?  
Economics is the **study of how individuals, businesses, governments, and societies make choices** about the allocation of limited resources to satisfy unlimited wants.  

- Concerned with **production, distribution, and consumption** of goods and services.  
- Helps us understand how people respond to **incentives, prices, and resource constraints**.  

> 💡 **Simple Definition:**  
> Economics is about **managing scarce resources** to make the best possible use of them.

## 2️⃣ Nature of Human Wants  
- Human wants are **unlimited** (we always desire more).  
- Resources are **limited** (money, time, raw materials, labor, etc.).  
- This creates the **central problem of economics**.

## 3️⃣ Concept of Scarcity  
- **Scarcity** = limited resources vs. unlimited wants.  
- It is **not the same as shortage**.  
  - **Shortage** → temporary lack.  
  - **Scarcity** → permanent condition.  
- Scarcity forces individuals and societies to make choices.  

🔹 **Examples:**  
- Limited farmland for crops.  
- Limited income to buy goods.  
- Limited time to complete all activities.

## 4️⃣ Concept of Choice  
Because of scarcity, we **cannot have everything we want**.  
- We must **choose** between alternatives.  
- Every choice involves giving up the **next best alternative** → called **opportunity cost**.  

🔹 **Examples:**  
- Student choosing to study 📖 instead of playing 🎮.  
- Government spending on healthcare 🏥 instead of defense 🛡️.  
- Farmer growing rice 🌾 instead of wheat 🌿.
